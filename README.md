built a Recipe Sharing Platform using React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend. Users can register, log in, and share their favorite recipes with details like title, ingredients, steps, and images. The platform allows viewing, adding, and deleting recipes, with authentication handled using JWT. I faced challenges in implementing secure image uploads and managing user sessions but overcame them with tools like Cloudinary and proper backend handling. In the future, I plan to enhance the UI, add search and filter features, and allow social sharing for better userÂ experience.
